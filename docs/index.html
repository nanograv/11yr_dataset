													       											Precision timing of millisecond pulsars over years
															and decades allows us to build <b>models of radio-pulse
															arrival times of incredible accuracy</b>. These models
															account for the pulsar's spin period, its evolution, the dispersion of radio pulses in
															the interstellar medium, and many other effects. Developing precision timing models for many pulsars allows their use as <b>tools to test fundamental physics</b>.
		    
												  </li>


												  <li>

			NANOGrav's goal is the detection and characterization of the low-frequency gravitational wave universe. To achieve this, we must be able to accurately time pulses to a <b>precision of 10s to 100s of nanoseconds</b> as they travel across the Galaxy.
												  </li>
												  <li>

												    Besides accounting for the intrinsic spin properties of the pulsar and dispersion, we need to determine where the Earth is in the Solar System, the pulsar's relative motion to the Solar System, the pulsar's motion if it is in an orbit with a binary companion, etc. We also need to understand where our sources of measurement errors come from in implementing a "noise model" along with the timing model. <b>Each Earth-pulsar line of sight is different</b> and therefore we need to model each one independently and in potentially different ways.

													  To determine when a pulse arrives, we fit a template shape to each pulse profile we observe. Since our instruments are inherently noisy, we do not perfectly measure the TOA and <b>there is uncertainty in our arrival-time estimates</b>. Other sources of noise are also introduced, from intrinsic pulse-to-pulse variations ("jitter") to interstellar-medium propagation effects to radio-frequency-interference around the observatories.
													</li>
													<li>
													  For each pulsar, we use a maximum likelihood approach to model its noise properties. We included terms to describe unaccounted for "white noise" (uncorrelated in time, some uncorrelated in frequency) as well as "red noise" (long-term correlations). These noise properties can be used to <b>quantify the "timing quality" of each pulsar</b>. Understanding them is crucial for understanding our pulsars as a detector for gravitational waves.
													</li>

													<li>
			We identified red noise in the pulse arrival times of 11 of our pulsars. Gravitational waves will cause red noise in our timing but may have different characteristics than <b>other sources of red noise, including interstellar scattering variations, intrinsic spin noise, or gravitational interactions with other objects around the pulsar</b>.
													</li>


													<li>

													  As our data sets become more complex, we are working to develop more sophisticated techniques for both <b>understanding and modeling our noise</b>.

														  It takes several years before we can see the sinusoidal patterns of the astrometric terms in our data, and therefore <b>we require that we have three years of data</b> on a pulsar before we include it in our data sets.

														We performed an <b>astrometric analysis of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08982">pulsars in our 9-year data set</a></b>.

														  In the 11-year data set, we reported <b>20 significant timing parallaxes</b>, with three being the first measurements presented.

					The majority of our millisecond pulsars have binary companions. The formation of millisecond pulsars requires material to be pulled from a companion onto the pulsar so that it is "recycled" and spun up to very rapid speeds with <b>incredibly stable rotation, allowing them to be the most well-timed astrophysical objects</b>.										  
										
															</li>

										
															<li>

															  Pulsars in binary systems have allowed for <b>extremely stringent tests of gravity</b>, including: providing the Hulse-Taylor system as the first indirect evidence for gravitational waves, searching for deviations from general relativity, and constraining variations in the gravitational constant over time.
																									    </li>
															<li>
														We performed an analysis of the 25 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00545">binary systems in our 9-year data set</a>. We found a wide range of binary pulsar masses and made <b>new measurements of the relativistic "Shapiro delay"</b>. We also found long-term secular variations in orbital parameters for many of our pulsars.


															<li>

															  In the 11-year data set, <b>we analyzed 31 binary systems</b> with a variety of models which describe the binary orbital parameters. Sixteen pulsars show significant Shapiro delays and five show a decay of the period of their orbits over time. As we obtain more data, our understanding of these systems will greatly improve over time.

						We have begun data reduction on 48 pulsars for the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set. While the timing baseline has only increased by 1.5 years, we have a 50% increase in data over the 11-year data set, with roughly <b>10,000 unique observations</b>.

						<li>
						  The 12.5-year data set will include new methods for processing and analyzing our data, along with comparisons to previous works. We are introducing wideband timing, which will fit frequency-dependent effects simultaneously and reduce the number of arrival times by an order of magnitude, as well as use <b>NANOGrav's newly-developed <a href="https://github.com/nanograv/PINT">PINT</a> timing package</b> to independently produce timing models.

																<li>
																  With a preliminary version of the data set, we have identified a second "<a href="https://nanograv.github.io/1713ISMevents/">chromatic timing event</a>" due to a structure in the interstellar medium towards PSR J1713+0747, one of our best timed pulsars. <b>Advanced modeling techniques are being developed to understand this event</b>. In addition, we are working on understanding the radio-frequency-dependence of pulse-to-pulse variations ("jitter") with the data set profiles.
		
																</li>



																<li>
																  The 14-year data set, with observations up through the end of 2018, will include timing on many more new pulsars, each with more than three years of data.
